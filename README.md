# MLOps Template with Azure ML and GitHub Actions

A comprehensive MLOps template for machine learning projects using Azure Machine Learning, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. This template provides a production-ready structure for developing, training, and deploying machine learning models at scale.

## 🛠️ Setup

1. **Prerequisites**
   - Azure Subscription
   - GitHub Account
   - Azure CLI
   - Terraform CLI

2. **Authentication Setup**
   ```bash
   # Login to Azure
   az login

   # Create Service Principal
   az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "mlops-template-sp" --role contributor \
                           --scopes /subscriptions/{subscription-id}
   ```

3. **GitHub Secrets**
   - Add `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` with service principal details
   - Add `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`

4. **Infrastructure Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Initialize Terraform
   terraform init

   # Plan deployment
   terraform plan

   # Apply infrastructure
   terraform apply
   ```

## 🔄 MLOps Workflow

1. **Model Development**
   - Develop model in `src/`
   - Define environment in `environment/`
   - Test locally using Azure ML SDK

2. **Training Pipeline**
   - Configure training in `mlops/azureml/train/`
   - Set compute and data requirements
   - Define evaluation metrics

3. **Model Deployment**
   - Choose deployment type (online/batch)
   - Configure in `mlops/azureml/deploy/`
   - Set scaling and monitoring parameters

## 📊 Monitoring and Logging

- Application Insights integration
- Model performance monitoring
- Resource utilization tracking
